This project contains the complete code from the Cloudstock San Francisco 2012
developer keynote presentation for the Salesforce Mobile SDK. 

Some MobileSDK specifics that the project demonstrates are:
1. Using OAuth and a SplitView Controller
2. Using the MobileSDK to call the Chatter REST API
3. Displaying Chatter profile images on an external device
4. Working with Chatter Accountfeed information
5. Querying and working with JSON results via the REST API
